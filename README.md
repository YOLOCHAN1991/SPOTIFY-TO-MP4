# sPOTIFY-TO-MP4
Making a program that downloads music from spotify using pytube.

You'll have to get your spotify client and secret ID and put them in the config.txt. (Below a link on how to get these IDs) 
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/
After that just execute downloader.py

Make sure you have installed modules pytube, pytube.cli, spotipy, re, spotipy.oauth2. (I'll try to make an installer in the future).
